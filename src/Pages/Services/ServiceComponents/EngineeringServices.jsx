        The pandemic has accelerated digital transformation, and businesses are
        embracing emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) to
        enhance the customer experience and stay closer to their customers. The
        technological shift and trends have propelled digital transformation and
        engineering of the next-generation applications to fuel growth, optimize
        costs and stay relevant and competitive.
        <br /> Enterprises face challenges in identifying the appropriate
        partners who can help them end-to-end in their transformation journey to
